# Ecommerce Website Frontend

Welcome to the ecommerce website frontend repository!

## About

This repository contains the frontend code for an ecommerce website built using React, Redux, and TypeScript. The project uses Vite as the development server and build tool.

## Getting Started

### Installation

To get started, clone the repository and install the dependencies using npm or yarn:

```
npm install
```

### Development

To start the development server, run:

```
npm run dev
```

This will start the Vite development server, which will rebuild and reload the application automatically when you make changes to the code.

### Building

To build the application for production, run:

```
npm run build
```

This will create a production-ready build of the application in the `dist` directory.

### Linting

To run the linter, run:

```
npm run lint
```

This will check the code for errors and warnings using ESLint.

### Preview

To preview the built application, run:

```
npm run preview
```

This will start a server that serves the built application.
